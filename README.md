You are, however, *not* encouraged to host this demo on an online website (see **Notice and Disclaimer**), at least not before you make safety modifications to the Demo code.

## Notice and Disclaimer

1. Please note that this Interactive Demo is a **one-off** which means that the Demo will no longer be updated *even if bugs or security flaws are reported*.  This also means that even if newer versions of PHP Test Fixture are available (e.g. ```v2.1.2``` or ```v2.2.0```), **this demo will still not be updated in any way**.  For this reason **you are strongly discouraged from directly extracting and using the Test Fixture from this Demo**.
2. Please note that this Demo involves **unsafe code execution** as ```eval``` is used in places with **no user input sanitation**.  Therefore, if you host this demo on your website (for example) without altering/safening the Demo code beforehand *you run the risk of your website getting hacked*.
